Passage is machine where use a vulnerability in the web system, use a bad configuration of ssh keys and a d-bus configuration to gain root access.

## NMAP

Using nmap we see a open ports 22 e 80

In the page don't have nothing, but in source code is found a directory and emails.

Accessing the directory, seen to be a news management system, based in this version of the system, have a rce vulnerability.

## RCE
Vulnerability: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48800
CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11447

Modifying the exploit and run, we get a reverse shell.

## User

Searching in the directories of the www-data user, found a directory with emails files.

But is on base 64, making the decode, found a sha256 hash.

Now hashcat can be use to decrypt the hash, of the user paul.

Now have the access to flag. The user flag is on /home/paul/user.txt .

## ROOT

Search in ssh keys, the user nadav share de id_rsa with the user paul, so can use de id_rsa to acess the user nadav.
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa nadav@10.10.10.206
``` 
Now i'm the user nadav, search in the home directory, found a .viminfo.

The groups are modified. Using this we can with a sudo user (nadav), overwrite files with permission root.

Source: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/usbcreator-d-bus-privilege-escalation-in-ubuntu-desktop/

Using this command is possible copy the id_rsa of the user root.

```bash
gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /home/nadav/id_rsa true
<method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /home/nadav/id_rsa true
```

Now the id_rsa of the root, use the same method used before to gain acess.
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.10.206
```
